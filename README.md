# how?
* Oilcan is arranged in *timbres.* You can think of each timbre as its own drum. Each time Oilcan triggers, it picks a timbre based on the note you're sending.
* You can find all of Oilcan's params in the `OILCAN >` param group.
## editing timbres
* Change `SELECTED TIMBRE` to edit different timbres. The selected timbre's params will populate below.
* Below the timbre params is the `MACROS` section. These params non-destructively multiply timbre params as they're played, acting as performance controls.
* Below `MACROS`, you can find trigger params for temp-saving and temp-loading timbres or macro settings. This can be used as a performance control, or to copy timbres to new slots.
* Below temp controls is the save system. *Everything is saved with your psets - this is for sharing sounds with other norns.*
